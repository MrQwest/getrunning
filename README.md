# Get Running

Eurgh! I really need to run more. I made this for myself. I wanted to show a random inspirational quote, video, image, whatever... enough to get me amped to put my trainers on and hit the road at 5am... and my word, I need inspiration!

If you want to add to the pile, submit a pull request to the run.json file with the following:

## type

`image | video | quote` are the options here. Well, anything can be used but these three work.

## resource

If you're submitting an image or video, drop in the URL, if you're submitting a quote, tap out the actual quote.

## source

Add in a name / title for the `via` link if you have one...

## sourceURL

... and the `URL` of where it came from.


Let's get running! I'm on [Strava](http://app.strava.com/athletes/694880) if you want to follow along and give me virtual high fives or mock me for all eternity when you notice my lack of running!
